Generate Test Data for Navactor
==============

A test data generator for [Signal K](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html) json forming time-series graphs of
marine reporters reporting their own info as well as that of their nearest
neighbors'.


see: https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html

Test output is validated against the Signal K scheme with the [Signal K project's validation tool](https://github.com/SignalK/specification).

also, long live PEP 621

Status
----------

* Implements the Signal K [full format](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html#full-format) spec.
* TODO: the Signal K [delta format](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html#delta-format) spec.
* Generates arrays of boats moving in different directions at different speeds.
* Currently boats reporting other boats is random and the nearest neighbor
feature is not implemented yet.

python -m pip install -e .
```

Usage
----------

```
signalkgen --num-boats 300 --nautical-miles 5
```

Validation
-------------

See `tox.ini` or `.github/workflows/check.yml` for automated tests that invoke the Signal K validation tools.

```
git clone https://github.com/SignalK/specification
cd specification
npm install
signalkgen --num-boats 300 --nautical-miles 5 | ./bin/validate.js
```
